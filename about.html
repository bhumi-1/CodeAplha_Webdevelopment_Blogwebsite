            <h2>My name is Bhumika. I love living with animals and learning many things from them.</h2>
            
            <p><strong>I used to afraid of animals</strong>. I had so many things that I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate any because creatures are that much intelligent</p>
            <p>Things when they are unfair around me and making me too depressed then the friendship and closeness of animals bring me out</p>
            
            <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
            <p><strong>I was very anxiety in thinking things to do</strong>. I literally learnt patience and caring of things from creatures.</p>
            <p>It is such a glad moment I am facing and staying with homely friends which are really cute and expressive.</p>
            
            <h3>Now I live the simple life</h3>
            <p>Now that I live simple life, things are so much better. I'm less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time to enjoy.</p>
            <p>With how much it turned my life around, <strong>I felt like I had no choicebut to start sharing how I did it</strong>, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well, living a satisfactory life of happiness and joy with hardwork results in a big success!</p>
